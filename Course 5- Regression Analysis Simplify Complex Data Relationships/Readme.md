### Module Overview

#### **Module 1: Introduction to Complex Data Relationships**
Covers the steps for building regression models, focusing on linear and logistic regression to approach different business problems.

#### **Module 2: Simple Linear Regression**
Introduces modeling complex data relationships through correlation, focusing on building and interpreting simple linear regression models in Python.

#### **Module 3: Multiple Linear Regression**
Moves to multiple regression models, explaining how they build upon simple regression and addressing topics such as model selection, overfitting, and bias-variance tradeoff.

#### **Module 4: Advanced Hypothesis Testing**
Explores advanced statistical tests, including Chi-squared and ANOVA, and their use in analyzing different types of data.

#### **Module 5: Logistic Regression**
Focuses on binomial logistic regression, explaining its application for classifying data into two categories and building insights from such models.
