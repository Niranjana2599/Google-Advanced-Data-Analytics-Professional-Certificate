### Course 6- The Nuts and Bolts of Machine Learning

This advanced course is part of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate program and focuses on machine learning (ML), a key tool in data science. It introduces the use of algorithms and statistical models to analyze large datasets, solve complex problems, and make predictions. The course emphasizes two major types of machine learning: supervised and unsupervised, while covering essential models such as Naive Bayes, decision trees, and random forests.

Guided by Google employees, the course provides hands-on activities that simulate real-world data tasks. The course builds on foundational analytics knowledge, making it suitable for those with prior experience in data analysis.
