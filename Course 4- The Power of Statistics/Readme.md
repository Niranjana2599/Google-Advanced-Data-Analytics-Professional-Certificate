### Module Overview

#### **Module 1: Introduction to Statistics**
Covers the role of statistics in data science and differentiates between descriptive and inferential statistics. Includes methods to measure the center, spread, and relative position of data using descriptive statistics.

#### **Module 2: Probability**
Introduces basic rules for calculating probability, including methods for more complex events, such as Bayes' theorem. Also covers probability distributions like binomial, Poisson, and normal distributions.

#### **Module 3: Sampling**
Explores sampling methods used by data professionals to draw conclusions from smaller data subsets and avoid bias. Includes discussion of sampling distributions for making accurate estimates.

#### **Module 4: Confidence Intervals**
Focuses on how to construct and interpret confidence intervals, helping describe the uncertainty of estimates and avoid common misinterpretations.

#### **Module 5: Introduction to Hypothesis Testing**
Covers the basic steps in hypothesis testing and explains how it can help determine the statistical significance of data results, enabling more informed conclusions.

#### **Module 6: End-of-Course Project**
Concludes with a project where statistical methods, such as hypothesis testing, are used to analyze a workplace dataset, putting the skills learned into practice.
